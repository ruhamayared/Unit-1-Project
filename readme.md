### Final Thoughts

I had so much fun building this web application! I learned so much about what goes into making an interactive website. I am so thankful for all the IA's for helping me talk through the code and helping me fix issues here and there.

As of right now, I have one unresolved issue: I wanted to style "Name", "Ingredients", and "Preparation" separately from the data I am rendering on to the DOM - but I haven't figured out how to do that yet. Other than that, I am happy with everything; I got to put in and get rid of everything I wanted to!
